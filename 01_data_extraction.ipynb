       "      <td>n Shapiro and this is Sing Out Speak Out. Here I give you the philosophies, ideas and songs I've been working on for many years but until now I've shared just too few of because I've been afraid of you and worse I've been afraid of me. My will to connect with you and share the best of me has grown greater than any fear and that's why I am compelled to Sing Out Speak Out. Well hello everyone and welcome to Sing Out Speak Out episode number 20. I know crazy, it's going fast this crazy year that we are having 2020. I know for a lot of people the hard lockdown and the restrictions due to COVID-19 are still in full force and in Australia we are very lucky that we've managed to squash that curve for now due I think in part because we have a smaller population and we had advanced warning of what was happening in other countries so I think that held us in good stead but we're not over it yet of course and we're not gloating in any way whatsoever. But I know it can be tough when you're stuck in the same situation even if you might still have a job but you're working from home and one day you're homeschooling the next day you're doing your job at home and next day it's the weekend but it doesn't really feel like the weekend because you can't go anywhere. Every day is a bit the same. It's like Groundhog Day basically. So as I'm introducing songs to the Kiss Tone album Way to Nowhere which I made with my great friends Mike Haveername and Lee Walker. I'm going to skip to track number four because it's called Today is Yesterday. I'm not going to say too much about the song I'll let the song do the talking but it was a lot of fun to record even though the message itself is kind of serious. All the horns and the strings you hear are played by real musicians all of those layered vocals we did together and just vocal on top of vocal and a lot of work went into this song it was a heap of fun. It's one of my favourite bass parts that I've ever recorded and thanks to our producer Lindsey Rhimes who was there for every note guiding us getting the best out of us when we recorded this song. I hope you enjoy it. Without further adieu this is track four from our album Kiss Tone album Way to Nowhere. The song is called Today is Yesterday. I hope you have a great week. I'll be back next week with another episode of Sing Out Speak Out.

       "0  n Shapiro and this is Sing Out Speak Out. Here I give you the philosophies, ideas and songs I've been working on for many years but until now I've shared just too few of because I've been afraid of you and worse I've been afraid of me. My will to connect with you and share the best of me has grown greater than any fear and that's why I am compelled to Sing Out Speak Out. Well hello everyone and welcome to Sing Out Speak Out episode number 20. I know crazy, it's going fast this crazy year that we are having 2020. I know for a lot of people the hard lockdown and the restrictions due to COVID-19 are still in full force and in Australia we are very lucky that we've managed to squash that curve for now due I think in part because we have a smaller population and we had advanced warning of what was happening in other countries so I think that held us in good stead but we're not over it yet of course and we're not gloating in any way whatsoever. But I know it can be tough when you're stuck in the same situation even if you might still have a job but you're working from home and one day you're homeschooling the next day you're doing your job at home and next day it's the weekend but it doesn't really feel like the weekend because you can't go anywhere. Every day is a bit the same. It's like Groundhog Day basically. So as I'm introducing songs to the Kiss Tone album Way to Nowhere which I made with my great friends Mike Haveername and Lee Walker. I'm going to skip to track number four because it's called Today is Yesterday. I'm not going to say too much about the song I'll let the song do the talking but it was a lot of fun to record even though the message itself is kind of serious. All the horns and the strings you hear are played by real musicians all of those layered vocals we did together and just vocal on top of vocal and a lot of work went into this song it was a heap of fun. It's one of my favourite bass parts that I've ever recorded and thanks to our producer Lindsey Rhimes who was there for every note guiding us getting the best out of us when we recorded this song. I hope you enjoy it. Without further adieu this is track four from our album Kiss Tone album Way to Nowhere. The song is called Today is Yesterday. I hope you have a great week. I'll be back next week with another episode of Sing Out Speak Out.
